        <h2><em>Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland&comma;</em> by Lewis Carroll</h2>
            <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank&comma; and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading&comma; but it had no pictures or conversations in it&comma; &quot;and what is the use of a book&comma;&quot; thought Alice&comma; &quot;without pictures or conversations&quest;&quot;</p>
            <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could&comma; for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid)&comma; whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies&comma; when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
            <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that&comma; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself&comma; &quot;Oh dear&excl; Oh dear&excl; I shall be too late&excl;&quot; But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on&comma; Alice started to her feet&comma; for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket&comma; or a watch to take out of it&comma; and&comma; burning with curiosity&comma; she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole&comma; under the hedge. In another moment&comma; down went Alice after it&excl;</p>
        <h2><em>Peter Pan&comma;</em> by J. M. Barrie</h2>
            <p>All children&comma; except one&comma; grow up. They soon know that they will grow up&comma; and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden&comma; and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful&comma; for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried&comma; &quot;Oh&comma; why can&apos;t you remain like this for ever&excl;&quot; This was all that passed between them on the subject&comma; but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.</p>
            <p>Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street]&comma; and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady&comma; with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes&comma; one within the other&comma; that come from the puzzling East&comma; however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get&comma; though there it was&comma; perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.</P>         
        <h2><em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&comma;</em> by L. Frank Baum</h2>        
          <p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies&comma; with Uncle Henry&comma; who was a farmer&comma; and Aunt Em&comma; who was the farmer&apos;s wife.  Their house was small&comma; for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles.  There were four walls&comma; a floor and a roof&comma; which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove&comma; a cupboard for the dishes&comma; a table&comma; three or four chairs&comma; and the beds.  Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner&comma; and Dorothy a little bed in another corner.  There was no garret at all&comma; and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground&comma; called a cyclone cellar&comma; where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose&comma; mighty enough to crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor&comma; from which a ladder led down into the small&comma; dark hole.</p>
          <p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around&comma; she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass&comma; with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was not green&comma; for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house had been painted&comma; but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away&comma; and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>
